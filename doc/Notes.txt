    "tempus fugit, aeternitas manet"

    (czas ucieka, wieczność pozostaje)

    === Idea ===

    === Main configuration file ===

array:
    id: O
    content: exec://bar.pl
    refresh: 00 00 00 * * *
        # format: (absolute)
        #   ss mm hh DD MM WW
        # where:
        #   ss = seconds
        #   mm = minutes
        #   hh = hour
        #   DD = day
        #   MM = month
        #   WW = weekday
        #
        # format: (relative)
        #   +iiu
        # where:
        #   ii = integer number
        #   u  = unit (seconds being the default)

script:
    id: foo
    command: foo.sh --verbose --object $O
    schedule: 00 00 10 * * *

array:
    id: P
    content: file:///etc/properties.txt
    refresh: 00 00 * * * *

variable:
    id: DATE
    content: exec://date +%F

script:
    id: bar
    command: bar.pl --test --object $O --property $P
    requires: foo
    schedule: 15 10 12 * * *
    user: guest
    skipped: rerun
        # rerun | ignore | error
    max_delay: 25m
    delayed: force
        # force | error
    max_threads: 5
        # Run no more then n copies of the script at the same time.

    === Script execution rules ===

1) A script is run when two conditions are met:
    a) it is scheduled ('schedule' parameter)
    b) it's dependencies had been executed ('requires' parameter)

2) Script is considered 'skipped' when script is scheduled n-th time,
while it's dependencies ware not met.
Such situation can be ignored, scheduled for later execution, or an error
message can be sent.

3) Script is considered 'delayed' when script is scheduled, but it's
dependencies ware not met for configured amount of time ('max_delay' parameter).
Such script can be run (ignoring it's dependencies) or an error message
can be sent.

    === Load distribution and balancing ===

Tempus will support distributed execution of scripts by using a gearman-based wrapper,
that will lunch tasks on remote machines.
